# Trackage

This organization aims to collate and organize the large body of tracking estimation output for the group. 

## Planning

See this issue: https://github.com/Trackage/trip-planning/issues/1

## Guidelines

Trackage contains a number of repositories, mostly R packages that relate to working with track data. Some of these will go nowhere, but others like `splat` will be the main worker for SGAT outputs. 

* use individual repos to report issues and ideas if they are directly relevant to that repository
* use the Issues [tab of this repo](https://github.com/Trackage/trip-planning/issues) for general discussion and ideas
* feel free to use the [Wiki](https://github.com/Trackage/trip-planning/wiki) for any other material
* make it up as we go!
