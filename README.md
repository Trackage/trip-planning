# trip-planning

## Stage 1

Build a shared repository of trip-estimation outputs and consolidate the tools for mapping these. 

* start smallish, three of us cover quite a lot of studies and variety of species and places
* consolidate the SGAT-Pimage tools into the [splat package](https://github.com/Trackage/splat)
* specify the  most-needed mapping outputs and work them up

Along the way we will 

* add lessons and workflows to SGAT / splat or whatever software we settle on
* prototype tools to query from the collated fits (mapview, leaflet, Shiny, RNotebooks)
* publish static documents and blog from this or related organization
* begin documenting who has loot and how we get it 

## Stage 2

Establish a long-term process for collating trip-estimation outputs. 

* obtain sufficient allocation for disk storage and database
* plan out archive of all the mess, we want to collate as much raw material as we can
* build map of all the contributors, and where/how we get their stuff
* build tools to automatically harvest the basic stuff, i.e. all the SGAT / tripEstimation fits

## Stage 3

World domination.
